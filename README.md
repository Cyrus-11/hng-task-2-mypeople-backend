## Introduction

This Node.js REST API allows you to manage a list of persons, including creating, reading, updating, and deleting person records. It's designed to be flexible, secure, and easy to use.

## Features

- Create a new person with a name.
- Retrieve details of a person by ID.
- Update the details of an existing person.
- Delete a person by ID.
- Dynamic parameter handling for CRUD operations based on name.
- MongoDB integration for data storage.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) database instance or connection string.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) (for cloning the repository).
